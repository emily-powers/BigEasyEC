## Problem:
In a Post-Roe society, it is more crucial than ever for young women to have access to emergency contraception. We see hotspots for the need for safe contraceptives at universities specifically and we seek to provide safer and more robust resources to these hotspot communities. 

## Our Solution:
We are creating a University template product to streamline the process in providing contraception to university students in a Post-Roe society. 
The biggest issues we saw with the current process was a lack of available volunteers as well as an unprotected backend system that wouldn't maximize the privacy of the clients. With our website that is chatbot compatible and linked to our local lockboxes we have a product that is easy to implement in universities around the country
### Lock box
We are designing a lock box that will sync with our website. These boxes will be placed in convenient locations on and around campus for students. 
Once scheduling an appointment to pick up EC directions will be given to the lockbox with instructions and a passcode within the website. 
This passcode will open on the website and activate the unlock feature on the lockbox. This allows for maximum privacy and protection. 
### Link to website: [Easy EC](https://epowers33.wixsite.com/big-easy-ec)
Interactive chatbot that connects with the lockbox will be embedded within 
the website creating a seamless, anonymous, safe resource for university students.
